# DiscordIdExtractorBot
A super simple ID extractor for your Discord Server

This Bot is a simple ID extractor for a Discord Server. It extracts all IDs from a server and sends an Excel file with NAME + ID.

Just add your Bot Token to a JSON file and provide a path in the main python file. Also, add your report path so the file can be created and then sent to you when you use the command "!memberlist".
